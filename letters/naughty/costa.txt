Dear Costa,

You must be very excited that Christmas is coming. Are you looking forward to
getting lots of fun toys?

Are you? Seriously? C'mon kid.

I've been watching you all year. Mostly by hacking into the camera of your Smart
Home Monitoring system (your Mom really should put a password on that). And you've
been a very naughty boy.

I can forgive a lot but when you ["  pushed your sister off the roof\n"] it was the last straw. If it
were up to me, you'd get nothing. In fact, I'd take back that Furby I got you
last year. But Mrs. Claus insisted that I bring you something on your list.
So you're getting the Lego

. But I'm making sure it's from the defect pile.

As for the Bear,Bicycle,Boat,Car,Blocks,: Better luck next year.

Remember â€“ I'll be watching you.

Regards,
Santa "All-seeing" Claus
